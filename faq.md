## What makes LIQ Network unique?

**Trade mining built into the LIQ token**

Unlike typical trade mining which is initiated by an exchange, LIQ trade mining is built into the LIQ token itself, that means trade mining is no longer bounded by a single exchange. Traders of the whitelisted pairs will be rewarded with LIQ, other project tokens, ETH or even stable coins. This revolutionizes the current DeFi space, making it possible to reward volume providers instead of charging them fees.

**Massive liquidity incentive**

LIQ holders can put their tokens into whitelisted liquidity pools of decentralized exchanges like Uniswap. On top of the swap fee given by the exchange, extra incentives will be provided by the LIQ team, which the rewards can include LIQ, other project tokens, ETH or even stable coins.

**Network level liquidity**

A substantial part of LIQ supply will be put into liquidity pools, this huge amount of tokens can greatly reduce price slippage and further encourage trading.

## Who can benefit from LIQ Network?

**Third party projects**

Liquidity plays a crucial rule in the valuation of a project token, which directly influences the success of a project. LIQ Network provides the tremendous liquidity to projects, so they can focus on what they do best.

**Exchanges**

The amount of trading volume and liquidity is arguably the most important indicator for exchanges, not only does it directly affect the income of exchanges, but it can also reduce price slippage and increase market efficiency. LIQ Network heavily incentivizes users to provide both trading volume and liquidity, making the exchanges more attractive to traders.

**LIQ holders**

LIQ holders are the first class citizens in the LIQ Network, they can benefit from being a liquidity provider or trade miner or both. By providing liquidity and/or trading volume, LIQ holders will receive massive rewards in LIQ, other project tokens, ETH or even stable coins.
